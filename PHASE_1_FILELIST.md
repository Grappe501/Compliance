## FILE BUILD ORDER

### ⬜ 1. `PHASE_1_FILELIST.md`
**Purpose:**  
Establish the authoritative checklist for Phase 1.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- File exists at repo root
- Build order is explicit
- Phase start time recorded

**Current Evidence:**  
- File content exists in chat, but not yet confirmed saved to repo root.

**To Verify:**  
- From repo root run:
  - `Test-Path .\PHASE_1_FILELIST.md`
  - `Get-Item .\PHASE_1_FILELIST.md | Select Name,Length,LastWriteTime`

---

### ✅ 2. `master_build.md`
**Purpose:**  
Establish the canonical build plan used by enforcement scripts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- File exists at repo root
- Content is authoritative (copied or reconciled from `master_build_v3.md`)
- All future enforcement points reference this file

**Evidence:**  
- `node scripts/plan_guard.js` reports `Plan: master_build.md` and produces a plan hash.

---

### ✅ 3. `scripts/plan_guard.js`
**Purpose:**  
Self-monitoring enforcement script that:
- parses `master_build.md`
- detects missing required paths
- detects unplanned drift

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Script exists at specified path
- Can be run via Node
- Produces clear PASS / OFF-PLAN / DRIFT output

**Evidence:**  
- You ran `node scripts/plan_guard.js` and it produced a full report.

---

### ⬜ 4. `package.json` (rewrite if required)
**Purpose:**  
Expose plan guard commands via npm scripts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Includes `plan:report`, `plan:create`, and phase snapshot commands
- Does not break existing scripts

**Current Evidence:**  
- Not yet confirmed whether this refers to repo root `package.json` or `apps/campaign_compliance/package.json`.

**To Verify:**  
- From repo root run:
  - `Test-Path .\package.json`
  - `Test-Path .\apps\campaign_compliance\package.json`
  - `cat .\package.json` (if it exists)

---

### ✅ 5. `.plan_guard/manifest.json`
**Purpose:**  
Initial manifest snapshot after Phase 1 scaffolding.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- File is generated by the guard
- Reflects the real filesystem

**Evidence:**  
- plan_guard output: `Manifest saved: .plan_guard/manifest.json`

---

## PHASE COMPLETION CHECKLIST

Phase 1 is complete when:
- All files above are checked off
- `npm run plan:report` passes without missing required paths
- Any detected drift is resolved or documented
- Phase End Time is recorded
- Phase 1 ZIP artifact is created and stored in `C:\dev\`
- Phase 1 is logged in `PHASE_LOG.md`
